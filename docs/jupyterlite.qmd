JupyterLite provides a full Jupyter environment running entirely in the browser - no server required!

## What is JupyterLite?

A WebAssembly-powered Jupyter running in your browser:
- Full Python environment
- Jupyter notebook and lab interface
- File system in browser storage
- No installation needed

## Structure

```
jupyterlite/
├── content/         # Notebooks to include
├── requirements.txt # Python packages
└── jupyter-lite.config.json
```

## Adding Notebooks

Place `.ipynb` files in `jupyterlite/content/`:

```bash
cp MyNotebook.ipynb jupyterlite/content/
```

They'll be available in the JupyterLite file browser.

## Python Packages

Edit `jupyterlite/requirements.txt`:

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
```

Rebuild after changes:

```bash
cd jupyterlite
jupyter lite build --contents content --output-dir dist
```

## Accessing

After deployment, JupyterLite is available at:
```
https://your-site.github.io/your-repo/jupyterlite/
```

## Limitations

- Only packages available in Pyodide
- Limited to ~100MB data
- No system access
- Persistent storage in browser only
```
