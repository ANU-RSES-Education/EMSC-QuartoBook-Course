JupyterLite provides a full Jupyter environment running entirely in the browser - no server required!

## What is JupyterLite?

A WebAssembly-powered Jupyter running in your browser:
- Full Python environment
- Jupyter notebook and lab interface
- File system in browser storage
- No installation needed

## Structure

```
jupyterlite/
├── content/         # Notebooks to include
├── requirements.txt # Python packages
└── jupyter-lite.config.json
```

## Adding Notebooks

Place `.ipynb` files in `jupyterlite/content/`:

```bash
cp MyNotebook.ipynb jupyterlite/content/
```

They'll be available in the JupyterLite file browser.

## Python Packages

Edit `jupyterlite/requirements.txt`:

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
```

Rebuild after changes:

```bash
cd jupyterlite
jupyter lite build --contents content --output-dir dist
```

## Accessing

After deployment, JupyterLite is available at:
```
https://your-site.github.io/your-repo/jupyterlite/
```

## Limitations

JupyterLite runs entirely in the browser, which brings some constraints:

### Network and Data

- **Limited HTTP access**: CORS restrictions apply
- **No direct downloads**: Can't fetch arbitrary data from the internet
- **File size limits**: ~100MB practical limit
- **Workaround**: Pre-load data files, or use Binder for data-intensive work

### Package Availability

- Only packages available in Pyodide
- Check [Pyodide packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html)

### Storage and Persistence

- Files stored in browser only
- Cleared if browser cache is cleared
- No sharing between users
- Download important results

### Performance

- Slower than server-based Jupyter
- Limited memory
- Better for learning than production

## When to Use Binder Instead

JupyterLite is excellent for teaching and simple examples, but for complex research work, consider [Binder](binder.qmd):

- Large datasets from the internet
- Complex package requirements
- Network-intensive operations
- Collaborative work
- Production analysis
```
