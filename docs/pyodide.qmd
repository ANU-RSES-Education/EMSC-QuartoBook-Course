title: "Pyodide Integration"
---

Pyodide brings Python to your web pages, allowing students to run code directly in the browser.

## What is Pyodide?

Python compiled to WebAssembly, running natively in web browsers:
- No server required
- No installation needed
- Access to scientific libraries
- Interactive learning

## Configuration

In `WebBook/_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
format:
  live-html:
    filters:
      - pyodide

pyodide:
  packages:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
```

## Usage in Pages

Create executable code blocks:

````markdown
```{{pyodide-python}}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.show()
```
````

Students can:
- Edit the code
- Click "Run" to execute
- See results immediately
- Experiment safely

## Available Packages

Check [Pyodide packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html) for what's available.

Common scientific packages:
- numpy, scipy, pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- networkx

## Limitations

Pyodide has some important limitations to be aware of:

### Network Requests

- **Limited HTTP access**: CORS restrictions apply
- **No direct file downloads**: Can't fetch arbitrary URLs
- **Proxy requirements**: Some APIs may not work
- **Workaround**: Pre-load data or use Binder for network-intensive tasks

### Package Availability

- Only packages compiled for WebAssembly work
- Not all Python packages are available
- Check [Pyodide package list](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html)

### Performance

- Slower than native Python for heavy computation
- Limited memory (~2GB typically)
- Better for teaching than production analysis

### When to Use Binder Instead

For complex tasks involving:
- Large data downloads from the internet
- API calls and web scraping
- Packages not in Pyodide
- Intensive computations

See the [Binder Integration](binder.qmd) page for full-featured computing.

## Best Practices

- Keep examples self-contained
- Use small, pre-loaded datasets
- Provide clear instructions
- Include expected output as reference
- For complex work, direct students to Binder
