Pyodide brings Python to your web pages, allowing students to run code directly in the browser.

## What is Pyodide?

Python compiled to WebAssembly, running natively in web browsers:
- No server required
- No installation needed
- Access to scientific libraries
- Interactive learning

## Configuration

In `WebBook/_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
format:
  live-html:
    filters:
      - pyodide

pyodide:
  packages:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
```

## Usage in Pages

Create executable code blocks:

````markdown
```{{pyodide-python}}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.show()
```
````

Students can:
- Edit the code
- Click "Run" to execute
- See results immediately
- Experiment safely
